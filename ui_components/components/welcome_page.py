            1. The first shot you animate will probably look crap. Using Dough is a skill - you'll need to experiment, iterate and learn - but you'll learn quickly!     
            2. Dough won't work well for all styles or all types of motion - like all artistic mediums, it has its strengths and weaknesses. You'll need to figure out how to make it work for you.
            3. The app will be slow the first time you use each function. It needs to download models and install stuff. Please be patient (but check your Terminal for error messages if it's taking more than 15 minutes).
            4. This is a beta - **please** share any feedback you have - especially negative stuff. We're focused on making this better and we can't do that without your help. We won't be offended by anything you say! It also is buggier than we'd like right now - especially on Windows - please report any issues!
            5. You need to press 'r' for new generations and updates to appear - they won't show automatically.
            6. To make something great, you will need to use a video editor like DaVinci Resolve, Premiere Pro or even iMovie. Dough is the first step in the process but editing is what will make it magical.
